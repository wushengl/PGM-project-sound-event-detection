# README

This code should be ran in Google Colab, model saving paths need to be updated before running. 

The code is mostly cleaned up, so running each block sequentially should work. Don't run the codes if they're in a block with "\[NO NEED TO RUN\]" in block title. 

The code has slightly different versions on 2 team members' computers, the main difference is saving path, another difference is, different parameters were tested on different notebooks. The uploaded version contains all of the code that is needed to run this project. 

Only best models were uploaded to this repository due to potential space limit, please contact team members for other model weights if needed.
